## How it works

The clock displays the current time both on an analog clock and separately down below it along with the current, full date.<br />
The stopwatch functions similar to a regular stopwatch on a mobile device.<br />
The countdown timer accepts an input (a natural number from 1 to 60), then starts counting down until the very last second and after that, displays the 'finished!' message.

#### First, clone the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ShayanTheNerd/multi-function-timepiece.git
```

Alternatively, you can copy the source of the project directly to your local environment using <a href="https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit">Degit</a>:

```sh
